# How to start....
TODO: App start from index.js. That represent controler and brain of app. 

First method of executing is getConfig, that returns a list of banks from config.json file.

JSON should be in format list of objects [{}] and represent data.
File name from client, must be mathced with js name. 
Type can be pdf and xls.

every js contains components for: header, footer, master and details data or basic.template.

We can generate report on 2 ways, as a master detail template or as a basic.template.

Master detail template use masterData and detailsData components for dynamic tables, and idea of basic is to be in use for a contracts.

Combination of componentes we put into containers (containers is asociation for one page) and containers represent a page or coomon template.
